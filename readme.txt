Convert users from Paid Membership Pro to Restrict Content Pro

== Description ==
This is a plugin that I put together for a client moving from Paid Membership Pro to Restrict Content Pro. It does everything we need but should not be used without examining the code to make sure it does what you need it to do. Let me know if you have any questions.


= Manual Installation =

1. Upload the entire `/pmpro-to-rcp` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate PMPro to RCP through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
